                    <p>Hello I am Sauhil and I am a second year student
                        studying computer science and studio art at the University of Virginia!
                        I am interested in working with software development, animation, and
                    anything technology, internet, or computer related! </p>

                        <h3>What Do I Do?</h3>
                        <p>I'm currently a student, but I am looking for an internship!
                            I code in my free time and try to improve my skills in
                            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python whenever I can! Also,
                            I'm passionate about theatre and singing.
                            I've been a part of a few musicals at my university and I am in a Broadway a capella group 
                            where I have sang in front of Broadway stars such as Leslie Odom Jr. from Hamilton!
                        </p>
